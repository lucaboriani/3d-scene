# Trick

delay the loading and execution of a threejs scene until the user somehow interacts with the page

this makes lighthouse and page speed insights happy...

just a proof of concept, nothing special

3d model is a picture of mine, somehow taken from an online photo to 3d converter, don't remember the site but I bet you can find one muche better than mine.
